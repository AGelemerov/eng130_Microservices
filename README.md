# Microservices

![micro-over-years](images/microservices-over-the-years.png)

Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:
- Highly maintainable and testable
- Loosely coupled
- Independently deployable
- Organized around business capabilities
- Owned by a small team
- The microservice architecture enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.

### Benefits of Microservices

- Improved Scalability
- Better Fault Isolation for More Resilient Applications
- Programming Language and Technology Agnostic
- Better Data Security and Compliance
- Faster Time to Market and “Future-Proofing”
- Greater Business Agility and Support for DevOps
- Support for Two-Pizza Development Teams
## Docker
Docker is a platform designed to help developers build, share, and run modern applications. 

### What is a container?
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

### Benefits of Docker
The benefits of Docker in building and deploying applications are many:

- Caching a cluster of containers
- Flexible resource sharing
- Scalability - many containers can be placed in a single host
- Running your service on hardware that is much cheaper than standard servers
- Fast deployment, ease of creating new instances, and faster migrations.
- Ease of moving and maintaining your applications
- Better security, less access needed to work with the code running inside containers, and fewer software dependencies
